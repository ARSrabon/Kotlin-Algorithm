# Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## The code

```kotlin
fun <T:Comparable<T>>quicksort(items:List<T>):List<T>{
    if (items.count() < 1) return items
    val pivot = items[items.count()/2]
    val equal = items.filter { it == pivot }
    val less = items.filter { it < pivot }
    val greater = items.filter { it > pivot }
    return quicksort(less) + equal + quicksort(greater)
}
```
