# Welcome to Kotlin Algorithms 

Here you'll find implementations of popular algorithms and data structures in Kotlin programming language Swift.

This is a work in progress. More algorithms will be added soon. :-) 

**Suggestions and contributions are welcome!** 


## The algorithms

### Searching

- [Linear Search]. 
- [Binary Search](BinarySearch/). 
- [Count Occurrences] 
- [Select Minimum / Maximum] 
- [k-th Largest Element]
- [Selection Sampling]
- [Union-Find] 

### String Search

- [Brute-Force String Search] 
- [Boyer-Moore] 
- Rabin-Karp
- [Longest Common Subsequence] 

### Sorting

It's fun to see how sorting algorithms work, but in practice you'll almost never have to provide your own sorting routines. Swift's own `sort()` is more than up to the job. But if you're curious, read on...

Basic sorts:

- [Insertion Sort]
- [Selection Sort]
- [Shell Sort]

Fast sorts:

- [Quicksort](QuickSort/)
- [Merge Sort]
- [Heap Sort]

Special-purpose sorts:

- Bucket Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- [Topological Sort]


### Compression

- [Run-Length Encoding (RLE)] 
- [Huffman Coding] 

### Miscellaneous

- [Shuffle] Randomly rearranges the contents of an array.

### Machine learning

- [k-Means Clustering] 
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- PageRank

## Data structures

The choice of data structure for a particular task depends on a few things.

### Variations on arrays

- [Array2D]
- [Bit Set]
- [Fixed Size Array]
- [Ordered Array](Ordered Array/). An array that is always sorted.

### Queues

- [Stack]
- [Queue]
- [Deque]
- [Priority Queue]
- [Bounded Priority Queue] 
- [Ring Buffer]

### Lists

- [Linked List] A sequence of data items connected through links. Covers both singly and doubly linked lists.
- Skip List

### Trees

- [Tree] 
- [Binary Tree] 
- [Binary Search Tree (BST)] 
- [AVL Tree] 
- Red-Black Tree
- Splay Tree
- Threaded Binary Tree
- [Segment Tree] 
- kd-Tree
- [Heap] 
- Fibonacci Heap
- Trie
- [B-Tree]

### Hashing

- [Hash Table]
- Hash Functions

### Sets

- [Bloom Filter]
- [Hash Set]
- Multiset
- [Ordered Set](Ordered Set/). A set where the order of items matters.

### Graphs

- [Graph]
- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)]
- [Depth-First Search (DFS)]
- [Shortest Path]
- [Minimum Spanning Tree]
- All Paths
